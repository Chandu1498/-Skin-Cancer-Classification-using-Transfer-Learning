# Skin-Cancer-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning

MSc Project 2022

The principal objective of this research is to investigate transfer learning (TL) by using
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for increasing performance on a new study by
utilising the information gained from previously acquired experience with tasks that are
similar to the new task. TL has been a significant contributor to the Medical Image
Classification domain owing to the fact that TL overcomes the issue of insufficient data
while also reducing the amount of time and resources that are required for medical image
analysis. Furthermore, randomised transfer learning configurations have been used in
the vast majority of these investigations. This study makes an effort to provide some
direction for choosing a benchmark TL technique for the medical image classification
challenges. We looked at several publications focusing on establishing backbone models
and TL techniques, including hyper-parameter fine-tuning and feature extractors from
scratch. The vast majority of this empirical research conducted model comparisons
among numerous model configuration iterations, and also with state-of-the-art models
followed by model comparisons using deep models and shallow models. Addressing the
TL, the great majority of this research used pragmatic bench-marking to compare several
methodologies in order to determine which one produced the best results with pre-trained
models. Despite the limited amount of medical data readily accessible, the research that
we investigated showed that transfer learning is effective. We strongly recommend that
data scientists and practitioners employ the proposed Transfer Cascade Learning(TCL)
approach where deep-learning(DL) architectures such as ResNet or VGG are deployed
as feature extractors while employing TL. These models may reduce the amount of time
and money spent on computing without compromising the accuracy of the results.
